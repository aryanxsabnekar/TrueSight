**About this Project**

With the increasing prevalence and development of AI Generated video content, we are quickly blurring the lines between what is real and what is fake. For this reason I am working on TrueSight whose goal is to be able to classify AI generated video content from real video.
This project is a downloadable video checker that helps you decide whether a video was created by Artificial Intelligence or is real. This project was created by Aryan Sabnekar on October 25-26 for HackPSU, Penn State's Hackathon.

Feel free to explore the repository and test out the checker yourself.

Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome!
